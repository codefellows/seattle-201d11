  - ***DEEP BREATH***....... This is a catch-up day for us. Today we're focused on reviewing and developing a deeper understanding of what we've been building the past three days.
  - We know it's been a hard few days, but the class is doing well.
  - Class today should be driven by the students more than the instructors. We're here to serve your inquiries.
  - It's not to soon to start thinking about final projects. Let's have a brief conversation about that today, because a week from tomorrow you're going to be divided up into teams and starting on your projects.
  - Tomorrow we'll look at some projects from prior classes and talk a bit about what to expect from Project Week.

- [Code Review](#codereview) *[75 minutes]*
