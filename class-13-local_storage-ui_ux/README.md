# Class 13: Add Local Storage to Your Vote Tracker; UI/UX Concepts

<a id="top"></a>
# Today's Plan: Week 3, Wednesday Lecture

#### Reminder: Quiz 7 was published last night and will be due at 11:59pm tomorrow night.

#### Quiz 8 will be published tomorrow afternoon, and will be due Friday night at 11:59pm.

On Friday afternoon we'll publish the entrance exam for Code 301, which doubles as the final exam for this course, and it will be due by Sunday night by 11:59pm. Do take this exam even if you are not planning to go to Code 301 right away, as it is part of your grade for this course. The exam is a bit different from the quizzes for multiple reasons:

1. It is longer: 25 questions. (Still all multiple-guess, at least)
2. It is administered by a company called EdRepublic and is actually their exam mechanism embedded in Canvas, so it is going to look and feel a little different.
3. You only get one attempt at taking it. No re-dos.

- [Code Review + UI/UX discussion](#uiux) *[until 10:15]*

- *Note: Depending on how code review goes, we might go ahead and introduce local storage before the break)*

***15 minute break***

- [CSSawireframeapalooza with Brian F. Nations](#css) *[45 minutes]*

- [Local Storage](#ls) *[45 minutes]*

**Learning Objectives**

As a result of completing Day 13 of Code 201, students will:

- Be able to understand concepts in persistence and the JavaScript commands needed to read/write to/from local storage, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and also by a quiz administered in Canvas.
- Demonstrate knowledge and command of JSON syntax and structure, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and also by a quiz administered in Canvas.

## UI & UX discussion

Let's have a discussion on UI/UX, and also look at a few websites (some awesome, some kind of randomly chosen) relating to design and interaction.

- [5 Ridiculously Common Misconceptions about UX](https://www.sitepoint.com/5-ridiculously-common-misconceptions-about-ux/)

When you start with your own projects, one of the things you will be fully responsible for is UI and UX. Be thoughtful. Find a design or layout you like and build something that mimics it. ALWAYS try to view your project from the perspective of someone who has never seen it before. Does the user need instructions? Are the user interactions clear to a new user?
