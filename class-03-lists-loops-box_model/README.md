**Learning Objectives**

As a result of completing Day 3 of Code 201, students will:

- Demonstrate understanding of and classify assorted control flow techniques in JavaScript including ‘for’ loops, ‘if’ and if/else’, as well as  ‘while’ and ‘do/while’ structures, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas
- Demonstrate understanding of and explain what HTML element attributes are and how to use them, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas
- Demonstrate understanding of and illustrate the CSS box model, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas

## Readings

- HTML Chapter 3: "Lists"

We're not going to go over the chapter on HTML lists in much detail in class but feel free to ask questions. It's pretty easy. Here's what's in that chapter:

**HTML Chapter 3: "Lists"**

- p.65: Ordered/numbered lists
- p.66: Unordered/bullet lists
- p.67: Definition lists
- p.68: Nested lists

## **Code Review**

Let's take about 30 minutes to do our first code review session. We're going to look at someone's code, have students read through it and explain it, take questions, and so on. Code review is an important part of professional development processes and also a key part of our learning environment in this course.

## Git Branches & Lab Prep

[Slides on using branches in Git](slides/git-branching.pdf)

We're going to go over the use of branches in Git and how that integrates into workflow. Up to this point we've been doing everything in the master branch, but from this day forward, you should generally never work in master on your own laptop except in specific use cases.
