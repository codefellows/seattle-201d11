# Student Comments from Week 2

### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE MOST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

Many of the same aspects that were helpful last week were helpful this week. It helped to be used to the routine this week. I am still very happy with the mix of ways we learn.

The book reading is helpful for me. Sometimes it doesn't sink in at first but when it's backed up by the lectures and labs it makes much more sense. I also refer back to them which helps a lot. Sam's lecture style is extremely engaging. He explains the topics thoroughly and in a way that is interesting and thorough.

As always, the lab sessions are the best periods of learning. They are challenging, frustrating and very educational. I have learned a lot by talking with other students, Sam, and the TA's and also learned a lot by problem solving myself.

The lab was incredibly helpful! You can get a basic idea of the concepts from lecture and reading, but it isn't until you put them into practice that they really sink in.

More help from the TA's. The classmates seem more comfortable together and getting used to the idea of pair/group programming, or just throwing ideas out/helping one another. This was week 2, and indeed was a hard week. The TA's and the teachers, especially Sam, were very supportive.

Learning more about Git and how we can access our saved work and past commits. I can see how it's much better than keeping our own documents. Code review is also very helpful, as usual from my same comments last week.

The lab time was phenomenal. Collaborating with other students and getting help from Sam or the TAs when needed was great. This was a hard week, and we all helped each other to get through it.

Having real code examples using similar structures/logic was really helpful figuring out our javascript assignments.

Seeing working code that does something similar to my problem helped understand the logic better and see other applications. Very useful.

Lab and code review are the most helpful aspects.

I found code demo in lecture is very helpful. It helps reviews the reading and also serves as a good example and reference for the lab assignment.

Nothing stood out in the 2nd week as being particularly more helpful than in had been in the first week, except having a day (Thursday) to focus on finishing up and solidifying all the new information without adding new material and assignments. It was a good day to feel more confident and reinvigorate enthusiasm and as such was actually a really important day to overall success.

Pair Programming

The morning code reviews have been really helpful.

Writing out comments as I was going along with the assignment, so when I went back over everything I could understand it better.

### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE LEAST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

So far, I still have not found anything that is unhelpful during class. I am taking it all in and learning a lot by using every aspect of the class.

Most things were helpful. Can't think of anything unhelpful.

*Switching a bit quickly from one part to another when the concept is new/somewhat complex, such as clearing the console quickly without warning, and moving onto to another/related idea.*

Not much to say here.

code review this week was not as helpful as it was last week because we mostly reviewed working code and I don't find it as helpful as trying to work on broken code together.

Everything has been helpful, but *I do wish that Sam had advised us in more detail how Git commits work so that we don't have to keep saving our work redundantly on our own. I wish we had gone through those tutorials in Week 1 to save ourselves a lot of trouble and establish good workflow habits with Git.*

Can we talk about how whiteboarding isn't the only way that some companies evaluate programming skills? Some companies allow for bringing side projects to discuss or doing a take home project. I know many of the big companies/a lot of companies whiteboard, but does it hurt to ask smaller/medium companies if they would mind if you brought a side project to discuss or ask if you could solve one of their problems (as a test drive)? Side projects and solving problems seems to be > than whiteboarding. https://medium.freecodecamp.com/why-is-hiring-broken-it-starts-at-the-whiteboard-34b088e5a5db#.1mpbc99mh

all is helpful.

Rushing through new information during lectures (which meant aspects that were really helpful the week before were not as useful due to rushing through them). Not enough encouragement and support during lab and letting students struggle on one thing for hours (well past the "15 minute" maxim). Doing code review on the same couple of students.

Lectures...

As the class progresses I've been finding the nightly reading not as helpful. Some of the concepts become easier to understand after discussion and examples in class.

The lecture.

### DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS, OR CONCERNS?


No I do not.

Nope.

I don't like how rushed we are to leave the classroom by 12 noon for meetings. I understand logistics are hard in this temporary space, but I wish Sam's and Aaron's meetings weren't scheduled so inconveniently that they always had to rush out during lecture. Is it possible to schedule their meetings during other timeframes that didn't involve rushing us out so abruptly?

The scale of 0-10 on these surveys is extremely confusing. My experience is very positive here and I want to reflect that, but I'm uncertain how to reflect that with the scale you've provided. If 3 is "struggling but finding my way," and 6 = "cruising along having fun", I'm lost as to what to pick. Because I AM struggling learning all this difficult material, but it's an enjoyable struggle. But if I pick something lower than 8, it's as though I'm saying my learning experience here is average, when I don't think that's true at all. My experience has been above average and very positive. Can you please change your scale to make it less ambiguous and simpler? I.e. could < 5 just be considered a crappy experience due to flaws in teaching and >5 would be a great experience due to good teaching? I think many students could get confused and inadvertently score good teachers low based off the unclear scale descriptions.

Not at present.

Having one-on-one feedback sessions *before* we need to apply to scholarship for 301 would be very helpful.

None.

nope.

None at this time.

No questions at this point

None at this time.

None. This was just a very hard and stressful week, until CSS. That's how hard it was, it made CSS look like a piece of cake. I don't know if javascript is for me.
