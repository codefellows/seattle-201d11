# Student Comments from Week 3

### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE MOST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

There was a lot to say about the CSS instruction:

- *"First, Brian Nations did a CSS lesson two days this week and I found it extremely helpful. The way he walked us through the process of building a very simple layout helped me learn a lot."*
- *"The way Brian walked us through the process of building a very simple layout helped me learn a lot."*
- *"Brian's lectures on CSS were extremely useful for me."*
- *"Always lab. And Brian's lectures."*
- *"Brian Nations' CSS lectures really put CSS in a whole new perspective for me."*
- *"Brian's lectures were excellent and his codepens make great references."*

**Sam responds: Lots of love for Brian, as it should be.**

*"Watching the 301 project presentations was very interesting as well. Not only to see what we will be covering in 301 but also to see what a group project presentation will entail."*

*"Thursday's lab ( practicing git workflow with teammates) was especially helpful."*

*"The merge conflict exercise with our group was also a good idea and a great gateway into teaching us how to handle real merge conflicts with our team."*

### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE LEAST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

*"A few of the articles we were assigned this week did not connect very well. For example, the past, present, and future of local storage. We got into local storage in class but a lot of the reading did not connect for me. It seemed far beyond what we had learned and I had a hard time incorporating it."*

**Sam responds: Agreed. I am going to revamp the reading assignments for ChartJS, and as for local storage, there simply is not a good article out there on how to use it. So I'm going to write one myself.**

*"Did not find the 'advanced javascript' to be helpful and would have preferred more time on git/github and/or time working on the week's assignment and/or developing project domains and project plans."*

**Sam responds: That which did not appear to be helpful now will be extremely useful in the future, and it takes a few exposures for the subject matter to sink in.**

### DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS, OR CONCERNS?

*"Maybe having the CSS lectures earlier would be helpful."*

**Sam responds: Agreed. This was an unusual case this month in knowing that Brian would be on vacation the first couple of weeks, then could come in and give these lectures during Week 3. He's SO GOOD with this content, and since there was an opportunity for him to present it, I decided it was worth the wait. Ordinarily this content would have come sooner.**

*"Learning journals are kind of a pain, and doing them daily is a hassle on top of everything else we're already doing. Can we consider making them bi-weekly journals instead of daily?"*

**Sam responds: Yeah, I can totally see that, and will adjust this assignment for future classes. This is only the second time we've had a 201 class do learning journals, so we're still dialing in the best way to utilize them.**
