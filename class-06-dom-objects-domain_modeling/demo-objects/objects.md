#JavaScript Objects

##What Is an Object?
JavaScript objects are convenient & powerful ways to group data and functions. They store data as **properties**, which are represented as `key: value` pairs, and can have **methods**, which are functions associated with the object.

Similar to arrays, but with semantic element names:

```javascript
var myArray = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

var myObject = {
	0: 'a',
	1: 'b',
	2: 'c'
};
```

Arrays are great for storing similar pieces of data, but get confusing if they contain mixed data.

```javascript
var samArray = ['Sam', null, 'Hamm', 0, true, ['Nadia', 'Spencer', 'Dan']];
```

##Notation
We can declare objects using object literal notation: 

1. curly braces
2. key: value pairs - colon between k/v, comma after each pair (except the last one)
3. 	properties - any data type, including other objects
4. methods - function(s) assoc. w/the object

```javascript
var emptyObject = {};
var oneLineObject = { a: 1, b: 2 };

var genericObject = {
  key1: value1,
  key2: value2,
  'multi-word key': value3,
  method: function() {
    //do stuff
  }
};
```

```javascript
var sam = {
  //properties	
  firstName: 'Sam',
  middleName: null,
  lastName: 'Hamm',
  rating: 0,
  isABoss: true,
  underlings: ['Nadia', 'Spencer', 'Dan'],
  
  //methods
  getRating: function() {
  	return this.rating;
  },
  setRating: function(num) {
  	return this.rating = num;
  }
 };
```

##Accessing Properties & Calling Methods
1. accessing properties
	1. dot notation
	2. bracket notation - w/string, outside variable. multi-word keys
2. calling methods
	1. `objectName.method();`
	2. methods declared in context of an object must be called in that context, so calling `method();` gives an error

##Modifying
1. adding new properties, methods
	1. use `=` instead of `:` because we're assigning a value 

```javascript
sam.employer = {
  name: 'Code Fellows',
  location: 'Seattle'
};

sam.logName = function() {
	console.log(this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName);
};
```

2. clearing & removing 
	1. set value to '', 0, or null
	2. delete	operator

##Built-in Objects
1. String, Array, Document, Math

##Prototypes
1. Every object has a prototype. It can be assigned explicitly, or is set to the global Object by default
2. All objects have the props & methods of their prototype
3. If a prop or method can't be found on the object itself, the JS engine will look up the prototype chain for it 

##this
1. complicated!
2. changes based on context.
3. when calling a method in the context of an object, `this = the object`

```javascript
sam.whatIsThis = function() {
  console.log(this);
}

sam.whatIsThis(); //logs the sam object
```
