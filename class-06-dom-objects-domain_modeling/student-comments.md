# Student Comments from Week 1

### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE MOST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

Doing collaborative coding with my teammates during lab. **Lab is great.** Doing code in a practical way is extremely helpful, and having other students to critically work through the problems with is humongous.

**Code review** was really helpful, it's very new to me and I learned a lot from it already.

**The lab!** Being able to really dive into the code and take what we learned in our lectures was excellent. Any issues we encountered the TAs were intentional about not giving us the answer but rather guide us into a direction where we could figure it out on our own.

**Code review** was very helpful. It helped seeing other peoples codes and discussing issues with them. Even though I had been working on the exact same assignments it was interesting to see the slight differences. It also really helped me correct my syntax errors.

**Lab was a great experience.**

I feel the need to try and solve things on my own to make sure I'm really understanding the topic but then when I get stuck or need to run an idea past someone the help is there.

**Working with my peers in the labs** was really helpful. Whether I was learning something from someone or teaching someone it all helped a lot. Of course, the labs would not be nearly as useful if it weren't for the morning lecture sections where everything was taught to us. The lecture and then lab format is a great way to learn.

**The lab is the most helpful part of the program thus far.** It's really great that pair programming and group work is encouraged.

**The labs were great.** The instructors/ TAs were very good at walking that line of providing helpful hints without giving way the answer. And the pair programming was really an excellent approach. We worked through a lot of really complex problems this week, and they were a lot easier/more fun to figure out when you were applying 2+ brains to the problem.

**Actually I found doing the daily reading assignment is really helpful though the instructor mentioned we could just skim through it. Since we don't cover everything in the lecture, it's really helpful to go through some details and minors by myself and have the instructor to go over some important major stuff in class.**

I found the **Pair Programming** very helpful.

The TA's and instructor helping was really great, and also the students. Getting different feedback but most importantly helping others allowed me to see different codes and decipher what was going wrong which allowed me to understand the material better.

Learning the practical uses of **Github.**

**Code review** in the morning is also immensely helpful. Feedback from TA (my assigned TA who grades my work is Munir) is also awesome. All TA's are awesome (Aaron is cool).

I've liked the **"following along" with the instructor as we code** collectively during lecture time. It hits the most "learning styles" and helps cement things: hearing what he's doing, seeing it on the projector screen, seeing it on my own screen, and most importantly physically (kinetically) typing the code myself and experiencing the results. It really helps with the muscle memory! The aspects that have been covered this way have been the easiest to retain.

I really find that the **lab portion of training is helpful** for me in understanding concepts. Being able to be hands on with code and asking questions when getting stuck is a great tool.

**I like challenging days followed up by easier material days.** I though the transition after two challenging days on Tuesday & Wednesday followed by an easier material day with pair programming on Thursday was nice!

### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE LEAST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

Nothing to complain about this week. I'm so happy to be doing this right now, and am really enjoying it quite a bit.

Everything was helpful

All of it was pretty helpful. **The format of how the classes are laid out.** I really use everything I have to help - the notes I take, the lectures, and especially the lab.

It's hard to say what the least useful part was. I am so new to coding that every piece of information was extremely valuable and I feel like I learned something from every aspect of the training. Maybe as I continue to go through the classes I will find something that is not very helpful but so far I cannot think of anything.

All good so far.

Everything was helpful, but **I think the lectures were less helpful than lab- in particular the lectures where we just go through the reading.**

This week I found everything to be really helpful. **Some material was a little overwhelming but that was expected.**

Nothing really. Everyday was an adventure to figure out about git, css, javascript and html. I love everything about the structure of this course and how they instructor and TA's promote us helping each other and working together to solve any problems which makes us think. Absolutely love it.

Honestly, nothing really.

**Readings.** So much of the reading this week has been review of things that we were mandated to learn as part of the pre-work, but having to read and respond to several chapters a night has been a bit of a time-sink that I wish could have been spent actually "doing" instead of just "reading". **I don't think the material is unhelpful, I just wish that perhaps more of the readings had been required during pre-work or at least that we would have spent less class time going over the readings page by page.**

I thought that I would find at home study difficult which at first it was but it actually is helping me become more family with the resources online and locating topics in the books.

Everything is helpful if you utilize the resources properly.

### DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS, OR CONCERNS?

None at the moment.

Not at this time.

None!

Not at this time. Just enjoying my time at Code Fellows a lot so far.

Not at this time!

Nope.

**I'm concerned about keeping up with the class, some of the code and information goes over my head but I think with the class setup I should be able to muscle through and continue to improve each day.**

No questions, concerns, or suggestions this week. I knew coming in to this course it was going to be challenging. Looking forward to what's in store next week.

**Sometimes I felt overwhelmed and other times I felt good about myself. I'm leaving the week with a better understand of everything.**

Not at this time.

None!
