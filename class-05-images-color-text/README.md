# Today's Plan: Week 1, Friday Lecture

#### We will start today by going over Quiz 1, which was due last night.

#### Reminder: Quiz 2 is due at 11:59pm tonight.

#### Quiz 3 will be published tonight (Friday) and will be due late Sunday night.

- Announcements
	- **Reminder:** Quizzes are open-book, so use the resources you choose to figure out the answers: books, internetz, JS console in your browser, whatever. And remember that the quizzes are preparing you for the 301 entrance exam, which you will take on the last weekend of this class (right before Project Week).
	- **Reminder:** Weekly surveys will go out to students in email today. Your survey responses are very helpful and meaningful to us. Feedback is a gift.

### Today's Schedule
- Quiz review and announcements [15 minutes]
- [Instead of code review, a look at the readings and a smattering of topics](#smattering) *[75 minutes]*

**break**

- [Git Branching, including deployment] (#git) *[30 minutes]*
- [Lab Overview](#lab) *[45 minutes]*

**Learning Objectives**

As a result of completing Day 5 of Code 201, students will:

- Extend their understanding of how functions work in JavaScript, as well as the component pieces including declarations, calls, parameters, arguments, and returns, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment.
- Be able to publish a static webpage on GitHub by creating a gh-pages branch.
- Extend their understanding of use of images, color, and text formatting to style and HTML page, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment.
- Extend their understanding of image formats (JPG, GIF, PNG) and the strengths/weaknesses of each format, as measured by a quiz administered in Canvas.

## Git branching, including deployment

It's time to take a look at branching in Git. We'll start with some slides:

[Slides are here!](slides/5-git-branching.pdf)

We'll also go over the commands and do some practice with Git branches together in our terminals.

## Code demo for today's lab

Today's lab is a 'one-off' lab, in that it is not directly connected to your weekly project.

You'll be working individually today. The GitHub workflow today is different, too, and is designed to give you a lot of practice working with branches, which is the last major piece of Git for us to cover. We need to spend a bit of time with it, and get practice with it, so that you understand what you are doing.

The concepts covered in today's lab (functions that receive input and return output) will be VERY VERY helpful for you in next week's project. Ideally you will continue to work on little problems like this over the weekend for additional practice.
